## Challenge #3 - people without employments

# Write some code that will return an array of all the people
# who have no employments.  The resulting hashes in the array should
# _not_ include the `:employments` key.
#
# [
#   {
#     :id => 20,
#     :first_name => "Savannah",
#     :last_name => "Clementina"
#   },
#   {
#     :id => 32,
#     :first_name => "Elyse",
#     :last_name => "Jensen",
#   }
# ]
